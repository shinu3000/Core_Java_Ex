## What is java
### Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

## Who developed **java** ?
### Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. **James Gosling** is known as the father of Java.

## What is **Platform**, is Java Platform independent?
### Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.
### And Yes it is Platform Independent, which mean compile once and run everywer.

# Java Example
```

class Simple{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
     System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }  
}

# java Variable
## variable is the name of memory area that is reserved , it stores some values and and can be changed if needed
### There are three types of Variable's 
1. Local : A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. 
2. instance : A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method.
3. Static : A variable which is declared as static is called static variable. Memory allocation happens during Memory allocation itself 

# Data Types in Java
## Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. 
1. Primitive Data Type : The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
2. Non-Primitive Data Type : The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

### Primitive means java is statically typed this means, any variable to de used first it needs to be Declared . 

# Unicode System
## Unicode is a universal international standard character encoding that is capable of representing most of the world's written languages
## in Unicode charecter holds 2 bytes.
